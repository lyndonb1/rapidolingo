# üöÄ R√°pidoLingo - Next Steps

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ MVP Complete - Phase 1 Done  
**Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Deadline**: October 5, 2025 (3 days remaining)

---

## üéØ **Phase 2: Voice Agent Deployment**

### **Priority 1: Deploy AI Agents to LiveKit** ‚ö°

#### **Quick Local Test (30 minutes)**
```bash
cd backend
python agents.py
```

This starts LiveKit agent workers that will:
1. Monitor for new LiveKit rooms
2. Join when students connect
3. Provide voice responses via Cerebras
4. Enable full voice tutoring experience

**Test Flow:**
1. Run `python agents.py` in one terminal
2. Keep frontend & backend running
3. Sign in ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí Start Lesson
4. Speak Spanish with the AI tutor!

---

### **Priority 2: Cloud Deployment** üåê

#### **Option A: Railway (Recommended)**

**Backend Deployment:**
1. Create Railway account
2. New Project ‚Üí Deploy from GitHub
3. Add environment variables:
   ```
   CEREBRAS_API_KEY=csk-***
   CARTESIA_API_KEY=sk_car_***
   LIVEKIT_API_KEY=API***
   LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=***
   LIVEKIT_URL=wss://wemakedevshackathontest-***.livekit.cloud
   ```
4. Deploy command: `python main.py`
5. Get public URL (e.g., `https://rapidolingo-backend.up.railway.app`)

**Agent Worker Deployment:**
1. Create separate Railway service
2. Same environment variables
3. Deploy command: `python agents.py`
4. Keep running 24/7

**Frontend Deployment (Vercel):**
1. Push to GitHub
2. Import to Vercel
3. Add environment variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_***
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_***
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://rapidolingo-backend.up.railway.app
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL=wss://wemakedevshackathontest-***.livekit.cloud
   ```
4. Deploy automatically
5. Get public URL (e.g., `https://rapidolingo.vercel.app`)

**Update CORS in backend:**
```python
origins = [
    "https://rapidolingo.vercel.app",
    "http://localhost:3001",
]
```

## üéì **Priority 5: Hackathon Submission**

### **What to Submit**

**Required:**
1. ‚úÖ GitHub repository (with commit history)
2. ‚úÖ 2-minute demo video
3. ‚úÖ Live deployed application
4. ‚úÖ README with setup instructions
5. ‚úÖ Description of Cerebras usage

**Submission Text Template:**

```
**Project Name**: R√°pidoLingo - Spanish Learning at Human Speed

**Category**: Cerebras - Build with the World's Fastest AI Inference

**Tagline**: Learn Spanish through real-time AI conversations powered by Cerebras ultra-fast inference

**Description**:
R√°pidoLingo is a commercial-grade AI Spanish tutoring web application that enables human-like conversations with <100ms response times. Built with Cerebras LLaMA 3.3 70B, the app features 6 specialized AI tutors, each with unique personalities and voices, guiding learners through real-world scenarios.

**Key Features**:
- ‚ö° Ultra-fast AI responses (<100ms) powered by Cerebras
- üé≠ 6 specialized tutors (teacher, airport staff, hotel receptionist, etc.)
- üó£Ô∏è Real-time voice conversations with LiveKit + Cartesia
- üìö 8 scenario-based lessons (restaurant, airport, hotel, etc.)
- üé® Full-stack web app with Next.js 14 + FastAPI
- üîê Production auth with Clerk

**Why Cerebras?**:
Cerebras enables natural, human-like conversations with no awkward pauses. Traditional LLMs take 1-2 seconds to respond, breaking conversational flow. Cerebras <100ms responses make AI tutoring feel like talking to a real person - critical for language learning where rhythm and timing matter.

**Tech Stack**:
Frontend: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Clerk
Backend: FastAPI, LiveKit SDK, Python 3.11
AI: Cerebras LLaMA 3.3 70B, Cartesia TTS/STT, Silero VAD
Infrastructure: LiveKit Cloud, Vercel, Railway

**Links**:
- Live App: https://rapidolingo.vercel.app
- GitHub: https://github.com/[your-username]/rapidolingo
- Demo Video: https://[youtube/loom link]

**Built in 4.5 hours by solo developer**

3. **Highlight Cerebras Advantage**
   - Compare to typical LLM delays
   - Explain why speed matters for language learning
   - Show metrics prominently

4. **Tell a Story**
   - Problem: Language learning is expensive/slow
   - Solution: AI tutors with human-like responses
   - Impact: Accessible Spanish learning for everyone

5. **Production Quality**
   - Everything should look polished
   - No broken features in demo
   - Professional design throughout

3. **Innovation** - Multi-agent system is novel
4. **Market Fit** - Solves real problem ($60B market)
5. **Technical Depth** - Full stack, well architected
6. **Completeness** - Everything works, well documented

### **Competitive Advantages**
- Only language learning app with <100ms AI
- Full web application vs simple demos
- 6 specialized agents vs single bot
- Professional UI/UX vs basic interface
- Production-ready vs prototype
